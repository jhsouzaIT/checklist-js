# 🛒 Weekly Shopping List

A simple and clean **shopping checklist application** built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  
Users can add items, remove items, mark them as completed, and receive visual feedback through an animated alert message.

This project was built as part of my frontend learning path.
